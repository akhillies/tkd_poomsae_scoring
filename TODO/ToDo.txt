To Do..... by the next UC Open:

Akhil: by june 8
0) small updates
	Change to updateAll function
	code cleanup with selectors - https://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
	big fix: modal still come up after alert for not entering presentation score
		just disable pressing submit until after all scores have been selected


Michael: by june 15
1) add competitor name, poomsae, and timer to scoring page
	-) name and poomsae can go to the top left while 3 scores are pushed to the right side
	-) timer replaces submit button
		originally, green button is "start", then shows <time> (left side) and "stop" (right side), and finally shows <time> (left side) and "submit" (right side)


Melvin: by june 15
2) screen size - should scale / work for all mobile screens
	-) what we have currently MUST work on phone
	-) whatever new we make does not have to work on phone but does on ALL tablets


Akhil: by june 15
3) backend schema
	needs to be able to take input 
		individual adding through forms and csv option for bulk upload for competitors
		add divisions and assign to rings
	1-2 tables to have info, need competitor ID (we generate, 1, 2, ...) along with division and scores/times by judges





4) make a homepage with metadata to direct which poomsae scoring screen with what names and such comes up. options are:
	-) indivudual/tournament
		-) if tourney, then pick table/judge/display
			-) if judge, pick ring/judge# and enter simple pin to authenticate
			-) if table, pick ring and enter passcode. table can:
				set pin for judges to enter
				pick which division/round (can chose division from another ring)
				change person if out of order
			-) if display, just show stuff, test to see if we can leave open for everyone
				no continuous updating - only show after submissions were made
				table decides when to show (by refreshing)
		






traditional poomsae backend support
	do this after testing sport poomsae


make the 6 presentation option actually work with page (currently no js interaction built yet) and needs to look better


COME UP WITH A BETTER NAME!!!! and some sort of logo/symbol
