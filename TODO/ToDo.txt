To Do..... by the next UC Open:


Michael: checkin june 25
make individual also have timer
make a homepage with metadata to direct which poomsae scoring screen with what names and such comes up. options are:
	-) individual/tournament
	-) if tourney, then pick table/judge/display
		-) judge, pick ring/judge# and enter simple pin to authenticate
		-) table, pick ring and enter passcode. table can:
			set pin for judges to enter
			pick which division/round (can chose division from another ring)
			change person if out of order
		-) display, just show stuff, test to see if we can leave open for everyone


Melvin: by june 25
Convert all CSS to SCSS
	-) screen size - should scale / work for all mobile screens
	-) what we have currently MUST work on phone
	-) whatever new we make does not have to work on phone but does on ALL tablets
move all scss so only 1 file has to be compiled and have it added by each page
	-) all sport poomsae options (tablet and mobile) works from 1 stylesheet


Akhil: checkin on june 25
Data storage for individual (persistent info)
Move all JS to 1 file
make simple script to compile all scss files (windows is same as osx!!)

HTTP Request with parameters for which person/division/etc.
	work with finding out how to access stuff and save it to browser
Work on getting the judge page to have the same look each refresh (so scores, times, etc. stay the same) PERSISTENCE
	test this by having your own apache server with the data to be sent out
look into Dreamhost and find out what we can do with it




NEXT TIME: ask people to test, SHIP IT OUT
	ask for name suggestions








traditional poomsae backend support
	do this after testing sport poomsae

COME UP WITH A BETTER NAME!!!! and some sort of logo/symbol
