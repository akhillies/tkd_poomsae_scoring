2) screen size - should scale / work for all mobile screens
	-) what we have currently MUST work on phone
	-) whatever new we make does not have to work on phone but does on ALL tablets

3) backend schema
	needs to be able to take input 
		individual adding through forms and csv option for bulk upload for competitors
		add divisions and assign to rings
	1-2 tables to have info, need competitor ID (we generate, 1, 2, ...) along with division and scores/times by judges





4) make a homepage with metadata to direct which poomsae scoring screen with what names and such comes up. options are:
	-) indivudual/tournament
		-) if tourney, then pick table/judge/display
			-) if judge, pick ring/judge# and enter simple pin to authenticate
			-) if table, pick ring and enter passcode. table can:
				set pin for judges to enter
				pick which division/round (can chose division from another ring)
				change person if out of order
			-) if display, just show stuff, test to see if we can leave open for everyone
				no continuous updating - only show after submissions were made
				table decides when to show (by refreshing)
		






traditional poomsae backend support
	do this after testing sport poomsae


make the 6 presentation option actually work with page (currently no js interaction built yet) and needs to look better


COME UP WITH A BETTER NAME!!!! and some sort of logo/symbol
