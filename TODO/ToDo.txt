To Do..... by the next UC Open:

COME UP WITH A BETTER NAME!!!! and some sort of logo/symbol

make options and some sort of home page to pick the link to go to (using meta data, this should also eventually allow connection to the google doc and pull info from it)

Adapt for any mobile screen size
Add key supports (f and j keys, with g and h as undo) 
Change to updateAll function

add server support (in addition to no-server option)
have option for 3 and 6 options for presentation scoring

Get rid of blue rectangle button outline on computer

Undo major/minor buttons turn yellow when you can't undo anymore and still selected.... doesn't look right


look into storing stuff on google excel sheet so no server is needed

make the 6 presentation option actually work with page (currently no js interaction built yet)

add a view port that also connects to the google doc to show final stuff that the judges did
