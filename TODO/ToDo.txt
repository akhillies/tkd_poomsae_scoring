To Do..... by the next UC Open:

Change to updateAll function
code cleanup with selectors - https://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
big fix: modal still come up after alert for not entering presentation score
	just disable pressing submit until after all scores have been selected


add competitor name, poomsae, and timer to scoring page
	-) name and poomsae can go to the top left while 3 scores are pushed to the right side
	-) timer replaces submit button
		originally, green button is "start", then shows <time> (left side) and "stop" (right side), and finally shows <time> (left side) and "submit" (right side)
	

screen size - should scale / work for all mobile screens
	-) what we have currently MUST work on phone
	-) whatever new we make does not have to work on phone



make the 6 presentation option actually work with page (currently no js interaction built yet) and needs to look better

make a home page with metadata to direct which poomsae scoring screen with what names and such comes up
	-) make options and some sort of home page to pick the link to go to (using meta data, this should also eventually allow connection to the database and pull info from it)
	-) add server support (in addition to no-server option)
	-) has timer, start/stopped by person behind desk

add a view port that also connects to the backend to show final results










COME UP WITH A BETTER NAME!!!! and some sort of logo/symbol
